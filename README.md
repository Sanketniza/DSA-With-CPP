		<p style="margin: 10px;">The project is organized into multiple directories and subdirectories, each representing a specific aspect of DSA. Here's a brief introduction to each part of the project:</p>
		<ul style="margin: 10px;">
			<li style="margin: 10px;">Core Functionalities: This directory contains the core functionalities of the project, including data structures and algorithms. It includes various files and directories that cover different topics in DSA, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. Each file or directory within this section contains code snippets, algorithms, and explanations related to a specific topic.</li>
			<li style="margin: 10px;">Project Modules: This directory contains the different modules of the project, each representing a specific aspect of DSA. The modules include:</li>
			<ul style="margin: 10px;">
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Backtracking: This module covers backtracking algorithms, such as solving the N-Queens problem and solving mazes.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Graph: This module covers graph algorithms, such as implementing graphs, detecting cycles, performing topological sorting, and finding shortest paths.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Hashmaps in C++: This module covers hashmaps and their implementations in C++.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Heaps in C++: This module covers heaps and their implementations in C++.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Linkedlist: This module covers linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Queue: This module covers queue data structures, including array implementation, linked list implementation, and using STL.</li>
				<li style="margin: 10px;">Searching: This module covers searching algorithms, including linear search and binary search.</li>
