    ? Problem Statement

    Given n dice each with m faces. Find the number of ways to get sum x which is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

Example:

Input: m = 6, n = 3, x = 12
Output: 25
Explanation: There are 25 total ways to get the Sum 12 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 6.
Input: m = 2, n = 3, x = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only 1 way to get the Sum 6 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 2. All the dices will have to land on 2.
