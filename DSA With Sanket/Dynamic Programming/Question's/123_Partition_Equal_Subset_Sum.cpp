    ? 123: Partition Equal Subset Sum
    ? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subset-sum-problem2014/1

    Given an array arr[], return true if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same, otherwise, false.
    Note: Each element is present in either the first subset or the second subset, but not in both.

    Examples:

    Input: arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]
    Output: true
    Explanation: The two parts are [1, 5, 5] and [11].
    Input: arr = [1, 3, 5]
    Output: false
    Explanation: This array can never be partitioned into two such parts.
