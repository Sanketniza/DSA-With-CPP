   ? Minimum Cost To Make String Valid

   ? link: https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-string-valid_1115770?leftPanelTab=0%3Fsource%3Dyoutube&campaign=Lovebabbarcodestudio&leftPanelTabValue=PROBLEM

   Problem statement
   Ninja has been given a string ‘STR’ containing either ‘{’ or ‘}’. 'STR’ is called valid if all the brackets are balanced. Formally for each opening bracket, there must be a closing bracket right to it.

   For Example:
   “{}{}”, “{{}}”, “{{}{}}” are valid strings while “}{}”, “{}}{{}”, “{{}}}{“ are not valid strings.
   Ninja wants to make ‘STR’ valid by performing some operations on it. In one operation, he can convert ‘{’ into ‘}’ or vice versa, and the cost of one such operation is 1.

   Your task is to help Ninja determine the minimum cost to make ‘STR’ valid.

   For Example:
   Minimum operations to make ‘STR’ =  “{{“ valid is 1.
   In one operation, we can convert ‘{’ at index ‘1’ (0-based indexing) to ‘}’. The ‘STR’ now becomes "{}" which is a valid string.

   Note:
   Return -1 if it is impossible to make ‘STR’ valid.
   Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
   Constraints :
   1 <= T <= 100
   0 <= |STR| <= 10^5
   STR[i] = ‘{’ or ‘}’

   Time Limit: 1 sec 
   Sample Input 1:
   2
   {{{}
   {{}{}}
   Sample Output 1:
   1
   0
   Explanation For Sample Input 1:
   For the first test case:
   The two valid strings that can be obtained from  ‘STR’ using minimum operations “{{}}”   and “{}{}”. Ninja can transform ‘STR’ to “{{}}” by performing the following operations:
   Convert ‘{’ at index 2 to ‘}’.

   Ninja can transform ‘STR’ to “{}{}” by performing the following operations:
   Convert ‘{‘ at index 1 to ‘}’.
   The minimum number of operations in transforming ‘STR’ to either of the two valid strings is 1.So, the total cost is 1.

   For the second test case:
   Given ‘STR’ is already valid so the minimum number of 
   operations required is 0.
   So, the total cost is 0.
   Sample Input 2:
   3
   {}}{}}
   {{{{
   {{{}}
   Sample Output 2:
   1
   2
   -1
