/* 
    Clone a linked list with random pointer
    link- 

    Approach:   
    1. Create a map to store the mapping of original nodes to their corresponding cloned nodes.
    2. Traverse the original linked list and create a new node for each original node.
    3. Set the next and random pointers for the cloned nodes using the map.
    4. Return the head of the cloned linked list.

    TC - O(N)
    SC - O(N)

    Note: This approach assumes that the random pointer points to a node in the original linked list.
    If the random pointer points to a node outside the original linked list, the approach will not work.

    Edge Case:
    If the linked list is empty, return NULL.
    If the linked list has only one node, return the same node as the cloned node.

    Example:
    Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
