    Given some activities with their start and end day given in array start[] and end[]. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a given day.

    Note : Duration of the activity includes both starting and ending day.

    Examples:

    Input: start[] = [2, 1], end[] = [2, 2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: A person can perform only one of the given activities.
    Input: start[] = [1, 3, 2, 5], end[] = [2, 4, 3, 6]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: A person can perform activities 1, 2 and 4.
    Input: start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], end[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: A person can perform activities 0, 1, 3, and 4.
